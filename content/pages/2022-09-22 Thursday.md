I went to my first Yelp Elite Event for a while in person. It's a social event. Food was great. Drinks... I don't know much about. Met some girls to hang out with... hopefully at the next event. Can we be friends? Not sure... here is my official [review](https://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-colette-lounge-mix-and-mingle-boston?hrid=qP3warRv5z_7FftmWtwh7A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) for the event held at [Colette Lounge](https://www.yelp.com/biz/colette-lounge-boston)
