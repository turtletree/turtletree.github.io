It's a nice day and we walked to Porter together in order to get my Lab work done.

Morning sun shine is so overrated :/ it's so bright and mighty, almost intrusive - it made me feel small - shamefully small.

On the other hand, sunset is a better time to be out there. You can look at the sun and don't feel judged. It's so tender and chill, almost non-exist - it made me feel small - comfortably small. poetic
