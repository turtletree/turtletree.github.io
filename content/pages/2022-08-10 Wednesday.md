This is my 7 years' anniversary arriving at this continent. Every year at this time, I'd feel a little emotional about it. I don't want to talk about the emotional stuff but some fun stuff.

I always wish I do some ceremonial things on this special day. For this year, the most ceremonial thing I've done is that I got 3 correct answers for Jeopardy! This is quite some milestone for a foreigner like me. Looking back two three years when I first watched Jeopardy with my then boyfriend, I couldn't even understand literally ANY question. Now I can get a wholesome 3 answers?! Give me five!!



Update on 2022-10-27 Thursday:

  + Now we watch Jeopardy way more often than before (recent favorite being Cris Pannullo, hell yeah attaboy) since I can understand more. The more I get involved, the more I feel like the person from the movie ["Slumdog Millionaire"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/): each question/answer reminds me of a specific situation that happened in my life. Unlike many other contestants or audiences, I didn't practice any of these questions, nor do I pick up these knowledge naturally in life (well I did for some of it...). They came to me on a specific occasion that I had a special impression on - this is life as an immigrant - I rebuilt my memory and life in English, sharply from the day I stepped on this continent.
